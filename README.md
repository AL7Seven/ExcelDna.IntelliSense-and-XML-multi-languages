# ExcelDna.IntelliSense-and-XML-multi-languages
A way to create and use a multi languages solution with ExcelDna.IntelliSense(64).xll and XML files.

In the link to V1.0 you will see:

  1. The code in _**SetCountry.bas**_ file
  2. The XML files you will need to start.
  3. A small UDF to show how it works. 

**[Go to the last version to see the files and download V1.0](https://github.com/AL7Seven/ExcelDna.IntelliSense-and-XML-multi-languages/releases/tag/V1.0)**

**For more details go to the [Wiki](https://github.com/AL7Seven/ExcelDna.IntelliSense-and-XML-multi-languages/wiki#how-it-works)**
